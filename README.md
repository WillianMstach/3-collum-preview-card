## My process
my process was to build the base of the model into a one-column grid, like mobile-first, then adjust it to a three-column grid.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
### What I learned

In this example what I learned was to use line-height

```css
.p {
  line-height: 1.7em;
}
```
